          <li>
            <strong>Red Roses</strong><br />
            A timeless symbol of deep love and passion. Red roses are often
            chosen for anniversaries, Valentine’s Day, or meaningful romantic
            gestures.
            <em
              >“I ordered red roses for our anniversary — they said everything I
              felt without a single word.”</em

          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Tulips</strong><br />
            Simple, warm, and sincere. Tulips are perfect for expressing care,
            appreciation, and gentle affection.
            <em
              >“Tulips felt honest and personal. Not too much, just
              perfect.”</em
            >
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Lilies</strong><br />
            Elegant and expressive, lilies symbolise admiration, respect, and
            refined beauty. Often chosen for important life moments.
            <em
              >“The lilies looked graceful and calm — exactly the mood I
              wanted.”</em
            >
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Sunflowers</strong><br />
            Bright and uplifting, sunflowers represent happiness, optimism, and
            positive energy.
            <em
              >“The sunflowers instantly brought a smile. They felt like pure
              joy.”</em
            >
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Peonies</strong><br />
            Soft, romantic, and luxurious. Peonies are associated with love,
            prosperity, and celebration.
